### Project Overview

1. This is to be a "container application" which should contain all the applications I want to build.

2. It should display the title of this project (Protocol 7) and a menu at the top if the user has a large display. If the user has a small display the menu should be at the bottom. This menu is always there. The user should then be able to scroll down to look at the different projects. These will be loaded in as needed until they have all been read at which point we should display a message indicating this is the end.

3. I would like the application to showcase what it is we are capable of creating. Given my job, it will be WebApplications only. We should use React, TypeScript, vite and vitest. These are all things I use at work. If you think it is usefull, we can also work with TanStack, but you don't have to if you feel it is overkill for what we are doing here.
   I want it to be coded in a professional manner, unsing best practices and not simply slap some code together. To me this means extracting code and configurations in files where possible, keeping files short, having unit tests if there is logic involved, even for seemingly trivial things, because that forces us to write testable code. I also don't want comments in the code. Code should be readable without comments.

4. I want the Container application to have a "retro cyberpunk" style. So, scanlines, monospace fonts, neon green, cyan, purple and amber. Maybe some red and orange for error and warning messages. And I want all the projects in there to have a similar aesthetic.
